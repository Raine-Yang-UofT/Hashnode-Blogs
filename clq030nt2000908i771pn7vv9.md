This blog is a summay of Chapter 2.6 and 2.7 of Rust Course ([**https://course.rs/**](https://course.rs/))

### match expression

The **match** expression follows the grammar below:

```rust
match target {
    pattern1 => expression1,    // returns expression 1 if target matches pattern1
    pattern2 => {    // can add statements before the returned expression
        statement1, 
        statement2,
        expression2
    },
    ...
    _ => expression3    // _ indicates any other cases
}
```

The match expression compares the target with patterns listed below (it is similar to switch statements in many languages to some extent). If a pattern "matches with" the target variable, the codes in the pattern are executed, returning a evaluated expression. Since match returns an expression, it can also be used for assignment statements.

The match expression must include all possible cases of target. The "\_" in the end represents any other cases not included above, similar to "default" statement in switch.

Here is an example use of match:

```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny, 
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => {
            println!("Lucky penny!");
            1
        },
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25
    }
}
```

match expression can also retrieve the values inside the patterns. In the example below, we use match expression to retrieve the "Hello Rust", x y, and r g stored in enumerate elements.

```rust
enum Action {
    Say(String),
    MoveTo(i32, i32),
    ChangeColorRGB(u16, u16, u16)
}

fn main() {
    let actions = [
        Action::Say("Hello Rust".to_string()),
        Action::MoveTo(1, 2),
        Action::ChangeColorRGB(255, 255, 0)
    ];
    for action in actions {
        match action {
            Action::Say(s) => {    // s will be "Hello Rust"
                println!("{}", s);
            },
            Action::MoveTo(x, y) => {    // x, y will be 1, 2
                println!("{}, {}", x, y);
            },
            Action::ChangeColorRGB(r, g, _) => {
                println!("{}, {}", r, g);    // here b is not used
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**match guard** refers to additing an if statements after one pattern branch to provide additional conditions for pattern matching. For example, the code below shows checking "x &lt; 5" with match guard.

```rust
let num = Some(4);

match num {
    Some(x) if x < 5 => println!("less than five: {}", x),
    Some(x) => println!("{}", x),
    None => (),
}
```

**@** operator allows binding a value to another variable. It is used when we want to simultaneouly have restrict on the pattern variable and use the variable. Consider the case below:

```rust
enum Message {
    Hello {id: i32}
}

let msg = Message::Hello {id: 5};
match msg {
    Message::Hello {id: id_variable @ 3..=7} => {
        println!("{}", id_variable)
    },    // case 1
    Message::Hello {id: 10..=12} => {
        println!("Found an id in 10-12")
    },   // case 2
    Message::Hello {id} => {
        println!("{}", id)
    },    // case 3
}
```

In case 1, we restrict the value of id in 3-7, and inside the pattern we still want to use the value of id. We can use "id\_variable @" to refer to the "id" in msg. In case 2, we cannot use "id" since id does not refer to a specific value but a range (the variable name "id" in case 2 shadows the "id" in message). In case 3, the variable id is unaffected, but we cannot restrict id in a given range.

### if-let expression

As mentioned previously, match expression must cover all possible patterns. However, sometimes we only want to check the matching of one pattern. In this case, we can use **if-let** expression instead.

```rust
if let target = pattern {
    expression
}
```

This is equivalent to

```rust
match target {
    pattern => expression,
    _ => ()
}
```

### matches! macro

**matches!** can compare one expression and a pattern and return true/false indicating whether the expression matches with the pattern. For example:

```rust
let bar = Some(4)
assert!(matches!(bar, Some(x) if x > 2));
```

### Variable Shadowing in Pattern Matching

When we use a variable name inside the pattern matching that is the same as the variable name outside the scope, the variable inside would override (shadow) the name outside.

```rust
fn main() {
    let age = Some(30);
    if let Some(age) = age {
        println!("{}", age);
    }
}
```

In this if-let statement, the printed value will be 30 instead of Some(30). This is because in the statement the variable "age" inside, which has value 30 (Some(age) = Some(30)), shadows the "age" variable Some(30).

The same would happen for match statement, even though it may be less obvious:

```rust
fn main() {
    let age = Some(30);
    match age {
        Some(age) => println!("{}", x),
        _ => ()
    }
}
```

The printed value is also 30 for the same reason
